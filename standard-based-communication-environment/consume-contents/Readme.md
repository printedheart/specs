--------------
During stay in a hospital, patient has had several clinical laboratory orders. At discharge time, a hospital physician selects the most significant reports produced by various facilities, including lab reports, and issues these reports individually to a health information exchange (e.g. SCE Shared Repository in our case) shared 
by a number of healthcare enterprises and primary care providers. Thus later on, during a new episode of care, the care provider of patient (e.g. his family doctor) will be able to access the previous lab reports of the patient through a health information exchange (e.g. XDS Affinity Domain).

####Description
--------------
At discharge time of an inpatient, a hospital physician selects the most significant lab results, produced by one or more laboratories of the healthcare enterprise, and builds a cumulative report sent to a health info exchange shared by a number of healthcare enterprises and primary care providers. This report aggregates the observations related to one or more order groups; if it contains observations for more than one orders it is called cumulative report. It is made available to anybody having access to the system, for instance the patientâ€™s family doctor.
